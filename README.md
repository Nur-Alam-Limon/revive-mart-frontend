## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs. Example of fetching all listings:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchListings = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}/listings`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching listings", error);
    return [];
  }
};
```
